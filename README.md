# veren
An IoT project with Golang and vuejs to automate my room

## About 
veren is an iot home appliance manager. It allows homeowners, know the state of their appliances and also alter them (turn on/off). 

## Business Logic  
<img href="business_logic.png"></img>

## Purpose  
veren manages home appliances. I stay in a single room apartment, it's my office and home. I want to automate the little things such as turning on/off my light bulbs and sockets. I want to do that over the internet via a website/app. I also want to keep track of everything I do to my appliances. I hope in extending this service to the neighboring rooms. Possibly convince them to use it. Just to make it better.



## Details
The app is built as a microservice with a frontend attached to it.   
The frontend is built with vuejs while the backend is written in Golang. Mysql is used for database management.
